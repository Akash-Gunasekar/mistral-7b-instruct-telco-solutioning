# Mistral-7B Instruct - Telco Solutioning Assistant

**Repo:** [`akash17/mistral-7b-instruct-telco-solutioning`](https://huggingface.co/akash17/mistral-7b-instruct-telco-solutioning)
**Base Model:** [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
**Fine-tuning Method:** QLoRA (4-bit)
**Domain:** Telecommunications (Solutioning & Business Analysis)
**Phases Covered:** 1â€“5 (Problem Identification â†’ Clarification â†’ Calculation â†’ Validation â†’ Executive Narrative)

---

## ðŸ“„ Model Overview

This model is a domain-adapted variant of Mistral-7B-Instruct, fine-tuned with **QLoRA** on a custom dataset designed for **telecommunications business problem-solving**.
It follows a **five-phase interaction flow**, enabling structured, phase-wise conversations with customers.

---

## ðŸ§  Capabilities

The model supports 5 solutioning phases:

1. **Phase 1 â€“ Problem Identification**Acknowledge the industry, use case, and customer; present ranked problem statements.
2. **Phase 2 â€“ Clarification**Ask targeted questions to gather missing information before solution design.
3. **Phase 3 â€“ Calculation/Projection**Perform high-level ROI projections or related business calculations.
4. **Phase 4 â€“ Validation**Identify missing/inconsistent data and block further processing until resolved.
5. **Phase 5 â€“ Executive Narrative**
   Present results as an executive-level business narrative.

## ðŸ“Š Training Details

- **Base Model:** Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- **Method:** QLoRA with PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
- **Precision:** 4-bit during training, merged to full model for inference
- **Dataset Size:** 100 examples across Phases 1â€“5
- **Tokenizer:** Mistral-7B tokenizer (EOS as padding)

## ðŸš€ Usage

### How to Install

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate
```

### Load Model

```bash
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline

model_id = "akash17/mistral-7b-instruct-telco-solutioning"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto")

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

prompt = """### Instruction:
Phase 1: Acknowledge industry, use case, and customer; present ranked problem statements.

### Input:
Industry: Telecom, Use Case: Churn Reduction, Customer: Verizon

### Response:
"""

result = pipe(
    prompt,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    max_new_tokens=300,
)[0]["generated_text"]

print(result)

```

### ðŸ’¡ Example Outputs

### Instruction:

Phase 1: Acknowledge industry, use case, and customer; present ranked problem statements.

### Input:

Industry: Telecom, Use Case: Churn Reduction, Customer: Verizon

### Response:

Output:

We understand your focus on churn reduction in the telecom industry. Here are the top problem statements for your consideration:

1. **High Attrition Rates** â€“ Verizon is losing 3% of its postpaid customers annually.
2. **Lack of Personalized Retention Offers** â€“ Verizonâ€™s retention offers are not tailored to individual customer needs.
3. **Limited Visibility into Churn Drivers** â€“ Verizon lacks real-time insights into churn causes.
4. **Ineffective Re-Engagement Campaigns** â€“ Verizonâ€™s re-engagement campaigns have low conversion rates.
5. **Fragmented Customer Data** â€“ Verizonâ€™s customer data is spread across multiple silos.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

This model is specialized for telco solutioning workflows.

While it can generalize to other industries, its strongest performance is in telecom use cases.

Best used with structured prompts following the Instruction â†’ Input â†’ Response format.
